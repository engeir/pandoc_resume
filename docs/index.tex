  {\em PhD, Climate Physics at the University of Tromsø} (Tromsø,
  Norway)

  Thesis title: Global temperature response to volcanic activity.

  The PhD work consist of running long climate model simulations with
  volcanic forcing and investigate the corresponding temperature
  response to volcanoes. The response to volcanic forcing is
  hypothesized to be linear. Further, analysis will be carried out to
  investigate the universality of the response to volcanic forcing with
  respect to any kind of forcing, possibly providing valuble insight
  into the equilibrium climate sensitivity.

  Thesis title: A model for IS spectra for magnetized plasma with

  \useURL[url1][https://hdl.handle.net/10037/19542]\from[url1]

  During the Master Thesis work I developed a
  \useURL[url2][https://engeir.github.io/isr-spectrum/][][python
  program]\from[url2] that solves an incoherent scatter radar equation.
  The equation is solved for any oblique angles between the radar
  pointing direction and the magnetic field line, and it accepts any
  isotropic electron velocity distribution. This made it possible to
  calculate the spectrum of suprathermal electrons observed by a moving
  radar numerically and compare to real observations, which was a new
  contribution to the field.

\startdescription{2019 (2 months)}
  {\em Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research
  Establishment} (Kjeller, Norway).

  During eight weeks in the summer of 2019 I worked at the FFI,
  continuing the project on software defined radios from 2018. The goal
  this summer was to be able to do real time spoofing of a GNSS (Global
  Navigation Satellite System) receiver, meaning it should be possible
  for the spoofer to make adjustments to the path the fake signal gives,
  in real time. Multiple open-source projects was used, some of which I
  modified or wrote myself during the project. The added code was
  written in Python, and the complete project can by found in my
  \useURL[url3][https://github.com/engeir/bladeGPS-Game][][bladeGPS-Game
  repository]\from[url3]. The project ended in a successful
  demonstration of real-time control of a spoofing signal.

  {\em Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research
  Establishment} (Kjeller, Norway).

  During nine weeks in the summer of 2018 I worked at the FFI on a
  project about software defined radios for use with jamming and
  spoofing of GNSS receivers. Open-source projects was used along with a
  number of different hardware, most notably the
  \useURL[url4][https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ub210-kit/][][USRP]\from[url4].
  At the end of the period, spoofing of both GNSS receivers and a mobile
  phone was demonstrated, and a report documenting the process was
  written.
