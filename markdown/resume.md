2019 (2 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During eight weeks in the summer of 2019 I worked at the FFI, continuing the project on
    software defined radios from 2018. The goal this summer was to be able to do real time
    spoofing of a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver, meaning it should be
    possible for the spoofer to make adjustments to the path the fake signal gives, in real
    time. Multiple open-source projects was used, some of which I modified or wrote myself
    during the project. The added code was written in Python, and the complete project can by
    found in my [bladeGPS-Game repository]. The project ended in a successful demonstration of
    real-time controlling of a spoofing signal.

2018 (3 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During nine weeks in the summer of 2018 I worked at the FFI on a project about software
    defined radios for use with jamming and spoofing of GNSS receivers. Open-source projects
    was used along with a number of different hardware, most notably the [USRP]. At the end of
    the period, spoofing of both GNSS receivers and a phone was demonstrated, and a report
    documenting the project was written.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Website
:   I have a website called [flottflyt.com] where I put up projects I work in my spare
    time, as well as any other content I find interesting. For example I have my own NFT
    storefront on the website that uses the [metaplex] protocol on the [Solana]
    blockchain.

Open Source
:   I maintain the project **[ncdump-rich]** which is published on [PyPI]. This is
    a previewer for quickly showing formatted metadata in `.nc` files, written in python.
    I also contributed to **[stpv]** which is a general previewing tool to be used within
    the terminal.

Programming Languages
:   **python:**
    Have been programming in python for four years with increasing intensity, creating
    multiple projects over the years. See my [github] for a closer look at the different
    repositories.

<!-- :   **shell:** -->
<!--     Since switching to linux and more minimalistic window managers than the standard GNOME -->
<!--     window manager on Ubuntu, specifically the [bspwm], I have been working more and more -->
<!--     in shell scripts to customise my set up. -->
