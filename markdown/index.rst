Education
---------

2020--2024 (expected)
:   *PhD, Climate Physics at the University of Tromsø* (Tromsø, Norway)

    Thesis title: Global temperature response to volcanic activity.

    The PhD work consist of simulating volcanic climate forcing and investigate the
    corresponding temperature response to volcanoes. The response to volcanic forcing is
    hypothesized to be linear. Further, analysis is carried out to investigate the
    universality of the response to volcanic forcing with respect to different climate
    forcings, possibly providing valuable insight into the equilibrium climate
    sensitivity.

2015--2020
:   *MS in Space Physics at the University of Tromsø* (Tromsø, Norway)

    Thesis title: A model for IS spectra for magnetized plasma with arbitrary isotropic
    velocity distributions. Link: <https://hdl.handle.net/10037/19542>

    During the Master Thesis work I developed a [python program] that solves an
    incoherent scatter radar equation. The equation is solved for any oblique angles
    between the radar pointing direction and the magnetic field line, and it accepts any
    isotropic electron velocity distribution. This made it possible to calculate
    numerically the spectrum of super-thermal electrons observed by a moving radar and
    compare this to real observations, which was a new contribution to the field.

2024
:   *Course leader at University of Tromsø* (Tromsø, Norway).

    * FYS-2019 Sun, planets and space (F24)

    Led both the lectures and the exercise classes of FYS-2019 during the fall of 2024,
    giving me valuable practice in preparing course material, lecturing and preparation
    of a 4h written exam.

2018--2022

2019 (2 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During eight weeks in the summer of 2019 I worked at the FFI, continuing the project
    on software defined radios from 2018. The goal was to do real time spoofing of a
    GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver, meaning it should be possible
    for the spoofer to make adjustments to the path the fake signal gives, in real time.
    Multiple open-source projects was used, some of which I modified or wrote myself
    during the project. The added code was written in Python, and the complete project
    can by found in my [bladeGPS-Game repository]. The project ended in a successful
    demonstration of real-time control of a spoofing signal.

2018 (3 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During nine weeks in the summer of 2018 I worked at the FFI on a project about
    software defined radios for use with jamming and spoofing of GNSS receivers.
    Open-source projects was used along with a number of different hardware, most notably
    the [USRP]. At the end of the period, spoofing of both GNSS receivers and a mobile
    phone was demonstrated, and a report documenting the process was written.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Website
:   I have a website called [eirik.re] where I put up projects I work on in my spare
    time, as well as other content I find interesting.

Open Source
:   Maintainer of the projects **[northern-lights-forecast]** (archived) and 
    **[ncdump-rich]** which are both published on [PyPI]. northern-lights-forecast is a
    program that listens to a website for updates on northern lights weather, and sends
    a message to a Telegram bot if conditions for seeing northern lights are good.
    ncdump-rich is a previewer for quickly showing formatted metadata in `.nc` files,
    written in python. Also made contributions to **[stpv]** which is a general
    previewing tool to be used within the terminal, for example with the file manager
    [lf].

Programming Languages
:   **python:** Have been programming in python for four years with increasing intensity, creating
    multiple projects over the years. See my [github] for a closer look at the different
    repositories. **go:** currently learning go following the [interpreterbook] and the
    [compilerbook].

<!-- :   **shell:** -->
<!--     Since switching to linux and more minimalistic window managers than the standard GNOME -->
<!--     window manager on Ubuntu, specifically the [bspwm], I have been working more and more -->
<!--     in shell scripts to customise my set up. -->
