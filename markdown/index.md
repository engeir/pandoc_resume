Education
---------

2020--2024 (expected)
:   *PhD, Climate Physics at the University of Tromsø* (Tromsø, Norway)

    Thesis title: Global temperature response to volcanic activity.

    The PhD work consist of running long climate model simulations with volcanic forcing
    and investigate the corresponding temperature response to volcanoes. The response to
    volcanic forcing is hypothesized to be linear. Further, analysis will be carried out
    to investigate the universality of the response to volcanic forcing with respect to
    any kind of forcing, possibly providing valuble insight into the equilibrium climate
    sensitivity.

2015--2020
:   *MS in Space Physics at the University of Tromsø* (Tromsø, Norway)

    Thesis title: A model for IS spectra for magnetized plasma with arbitrary isotropic
    velocity distributions. Link: [https://hdl.handle.net/10037/19542]

    During the Master Thesis work I developed a [python program] that solves an incoherent
    scatter radar equation. The equation is solved for any oblique angles between the
    radar pointing direction and the magnetic field line, and it accepts any isotropic
    electron velocity distribution. This made it possible to calculate the spectrum of
    suprathermal electrons observed by a moving radar numerically and compare to real
    observations, which was a new contribution to the field.

2019 (2 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During eight weeks in the summer of 2019 I worked at the FFI, continuing the project
    on software defined radios from 2018. The goal this summer was to be able to do real
    time spoofing of a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver, meaning it
    should be possible for the spoofer to make adjustments to the path the fake signal
    gives, in real time. Multiple open-source projects was used, some of which I modified
    or wrote myself during the project. The added code was written in Python, and the
    complete project can by found in my [bladeGPS-Game repository]. The project ended in
    a successful demonstration of real-time control of a spoofing signal.

2018 (3 months)
:   *Summer student at FFI --- Norwegian Defence Research Establishment* (Kjeller, Norway).

    During nine weeks in the summer of 2018 I worked at the FFI on a project about
    software defined radios for use with jamming and spoofing of GNSS receivers.
    Open-source projects was used along with a number of different hardware, most notably
    the [USRP]. At the end of the period, spoofing of both GNSS receivers and a mobile
    phone was demonstrated, and a report documenting the process was written.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Website
:   I have a website called [flottflyt.com] where I put up projects I work on in my spare
    time, as well as any other content I find interesting. There, you can find my own NFT
    storefront that uses the [metaplex] protocol on the [Solana] blockchain.

Open Source
:   Maintainer of the project **[ncdump-rich]** which is published on [PyPI]. This is
    a previewer for quickly showing formatted metadata in `.nc` files, written in python.
    Also made contributions to **[stpv]** which is a general previewing tool to be used
    within the terminal, for example with the file manager [lf].

Programming Languages
:   **python:**
    Have been programming in python for four years with increasing intensity, creating
    multiple projects over the years. See my [github] for a closer look at the different
    repositories.

<!-- :   **shell:** -->
<!--     Since switching to linux and more minimalistic window managers than the standard GNOME -->
<!--     window manager on Ubuntu, specifically the [bspwm], I have been working more and more -->
<!--     in shell scripts to customise my set up. -->
